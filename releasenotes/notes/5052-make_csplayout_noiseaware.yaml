        A new layout method is introduced based on the CSPLayout but features an additional noise awareness.
    
        * :class:`qiskit.transpiler.layout.csp_layout` got refactored. A new parameter 'limit_solutions' was
          introduced. It allows to decide wether the first found solution should be taken or all possible solutions should be calculated, choosing the one with highest expected fidelity. Furthermore, the 'run' method was 
          refactored to allow for a concise layout.
