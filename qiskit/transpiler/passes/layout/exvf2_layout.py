"""A pass for choosing a Layout of a circuit onto a Coupling graph,
as a subgraph isomorphism problem, solved by VF2++. It tries to find
a solution that satisfies the circuit as much as possible, i.e. only 
few further swap are needed. It is implemented such that the method 
will always find a solution.
